# Beyond-Shyness-Setf-Esteem-and-Classroom

Overview: Classroom participation is essential for effective learning, but many students hesitate to engage due to fear of negative evaluation. This research explores how self-esteem influences participation, using survey data and validated self-esteem scales to identify trends in student behavior. The findings provide insights into psychological factors affecting active learning.

Survey & Data:

Participants: Students aged 18–22

Self-Esteem: Measured using the Rosenberg scale (0–30) - ≤15 → Low self-esteem AND >15 → High self-esteem

Questions:
1. Interest in participating (Yes / No / Maybe)
2. Avoid asking questions (Yes / No / Maybe)
3. Avoid answering questions (Yes / No / Maybe)
4. Factors compromising participation (Judged, Second Thoughts, Laughed, Lazy, Scolded)

Key Insights:

Low self-esteem → Less participation

High self-esteem → More active participation

Main factors limiting participation: Being judged (45.8%), second thoughts (31.3%), fear of being laughed at (29.2%)

Most students are interested but held back by fear or lack of confidence

Dataset: Synthetic dataset with 100 records included: self_esteem_class_participation.csv
